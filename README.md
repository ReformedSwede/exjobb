####Dependencies:

GrammaticalFramework, JPGF library

####Notes:

The desktop app assumes there is a directory (user/grammar) that contains .gf files sorted in folders for each session. This folder, with sub-directories and .gf files, must exist for the program to work, at least for now. The program should at a later point in development be able to auto-generate these if they don't exist.
